# Notes for actual implementation:
# - `client` fixture: Provided by TestClient(app).
# - `mock_auth_as_teacher`, `mock_auth_as_parent`, `mock_auth_as_student`: These fixtures would override
#   the `get_current_user` dependency to return a DomainUser with the specified role.
# - `mock_auth_as_teacher_that_gets_notfound`: A more specific fixture that would also mock the
#   `ListAssessmentsByReadingIdUseCase` or its underlying repositories to simulate a scenario
#   where the reading_id leads to a NotFoundException from the use case.
# - Actual data setup (creating users, readings, assessments, links in a test DB) or more detailed
#   mocking of use case return values is needed for thorough testing.
# - The current placeholders for response data checks are conceptual and would be filled in
#   once the mocking/data setup strategy is finalized for the test suite.
