# Notes for actual implementation of these tests:
# - A `conftest.py` would be essential for managing fixtures like `client`, database setup/teardown,
#   and utility functions for creating test data (users, readings, assessments).
# - Dependency overrides for services (like PasswordService) or repositories (to return specific mock data)
#   would be applied to the FastAPI app instance used by TestClient.
# - `mock_override_auth_parent` is a placeholder for a fixture that correctly mocks the
#   `require_role(UserRole.PARENT)` dependency to return a known parent user and handles token generation/headers.
# - `setup_parent_child_reading`, `setup_assignments_for_child`, `setup_child_assignment` are placeholder fixtures
#   that would create necessary DB entities for the tests to run.
# - Testing various error conditions (401, 403, 404, 422) would also be crucial.
