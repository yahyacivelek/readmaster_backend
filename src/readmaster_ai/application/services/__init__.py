"""
Application Services Layer for Readmaster.ai.

This package contains services that orchestrate application logic and
interact with domain entities, repositories, and other services.
These services are typically used by use cases or directly by the
presentation layer (e.g., API routers) if the logic is simple enough
or doesn't fit a specific "use case" pattern.

Examples:
- AuthenticationService (handles login, token generation)
- NotificationService (handles sending notifications, though the domain one is for observer pattern)
- FileProcessingService
