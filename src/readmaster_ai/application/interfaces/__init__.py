# This package will hold abstract interfaces for services
# that the application layer depends on, but whose concrete
# implementations reside in the infrastructure layer.
# For example:
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# class AIAnalysisInterface(ABC):
#     @abstractmethod
#     async def analyze_audio(self, audio_url: str) -> dict:
#         pass
pass
