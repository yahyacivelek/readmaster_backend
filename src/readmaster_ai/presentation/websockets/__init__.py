"""
WebSockets Package for Readmaster.ai.

This package contains modules related to WebSocket communication,
including:
- ConnectionManager: For managing active WebSocket connections.
- WebSocket Routers: For defining WebSocket endpoints and handling messages. (Though routers are typically in api/v1)

Currently, this primarily houses the ConnectionManager. WebSocket route definitions
are typically co-located with other API routes under presentation/api/ for consistency,
or could be moved here if the number of WebSocket-specific routes grows significantly.
